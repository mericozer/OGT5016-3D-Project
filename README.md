QUALITY CONTROL DEPARTMENT

3D puzzle game for Game Development Technics course. You are starting as a robot named Virtus-001. Your mission is to complete some puzzles without a margin of error. If you do a mistake on the puzzle or get caught by enemy robots, Quality Control Department is going to exterminate you. If you get exterminated you'll start to level with a brand new version of yourself. As an example, you start Virtus-002 after 001 and the serial code goes on as long as you failed on the levels.

Good Luck!
